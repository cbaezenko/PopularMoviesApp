## Project Overview

* You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
* You'll create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
* You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
* Built a UI that presented the user with a grid of movie posters, allowed users to change sort order, and presented a screen with additional information on the movie selected by the user:
